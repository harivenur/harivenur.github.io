            <p> I am a tropical ecologist, finishing a PhD at the Yale University in New Haven, CT, USA. 
              I am professionally trained, skilled and experienced in four fields: tropical forest ecology, wildlife conservation, agriculture, and journalism.
              If you think that's quite a mix, it was achieved over many years of focussed work in a direction that helped me make more sense of the world around me. 
              I have Bachelor's and Master's degrees on the first three (from Kerala Agricultural University and Yale University), and a diploma in the last one (from Thiruvananthapuram Press Club), 
              and I have worked about a decade with non-governmental conservation agencies, activist groups and professional media houses in the United States and India. 
              I have worked in a range of conservation projects thoughout Central and South America, India, Africa, South East Asia, and Central Asia, mostly on mammals and reptiles, and also on trees.
              My connection to plants is more special to me than the one to animals or fungi, and I am pretty good with tropical plant families. 
              I have professional skills in English and Malayalam (published in both); I am fluent in Hindi, and speak Spanish and Tamil. </p>
            <p> I am currently a plant community ecologist, studying herbaceous plant diversity in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) for my PhD dissertation. 
              Herbaceous plants are cool, and I enjoy my work! After my PhD, I look forward to working more on the ecology of tropical forest plants, 
              especially, their diversity, biotic and abiotic interactions, and how they make sense to the human world.</p>

            <div class="h5">Herb diversity in seasonally dry tropical forests of Western Ghats, India</div>
            <p> Much of our understanding of the patterns and drivers on the plant diversity in tropical forests comes from trees, 
              despite trees forming only up to a quarter of all plant species in these forests. It is unclear whether assumptions and predictions based on 
              trees hold good for all other lifeforms, but we continue to do so. Understory herbaceous angiosperms, which could form over 40% of plant biodiversity in 
              some tropical forests, have received relatively little attention. My work tries to uncover the spatial and temporal variation of herb diversity (alpha and beta) 
              in a seasonally dry tropical forest in India's Western Ghats. Rainfall in this protected SDTF, called Mudumalai National Park and Tiger Reserve, changes
              about 1000 mm from east to west over just 40 km, causing a wide variation in vegetation from scrub forest at one end to semi-evergreen forest at the other.
              Such a strong rainfall gradient also creates gradients of co-variables, especially, that of understory light. Others have found that diversity and density of trees in
              this gradient increases with increase in rainfall. How does the diversity and community composition of understory herbs, which could be influenced by both light and water,
              two critical abiotic factors, and their co-variables, actually fare along such gradients? Look forward to reading my publications.</p>
              
              <p>For my dissertation research, I work under the guidance of <a href="http://www.comitalab.com/">Dr Liza Comita</a>, and
                with abundant help from various taxonomists and botanists in India, especially, the lab of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_Sukumar">Dr Raman Sukumar</a>

            <p> For my Master's Research at Yale, I worked on soils where a secondary hemiepiphyte of the genus Heteropsis (Family: Araceae) in the rainforests
              of the Caura River, a major tributary of the mighty Orinoco in Venezuela. The plant’s roots are widely used by tribal populations throughout
              the Guyana-shield rainforests and northern Amazonia as a lashing material, almost like a rattan. Living with the Ye'kuana people in the deep Caura forests,
              I collected data on two Heteropsis species: H. flexuosa and H. spruceana, to see if the plant is affected by soils disturbed by slash and burn farming. 
              I found that Heteropsis grows only on trees in old-growth forests, and avoids disturbed forests, even after about 40 years of recovery, 
              despite abundant seed dispersal from the old-growth around it. From the soil texture, I guessed this was probably due to the failure 
              of its seeds to germinate in the humus-depleted and high-clay topsoil of disturbed forests.</p> 
              
              <p> For this study, I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://environment.yale.edu/profile/montagnini">Dr Florencia Montagnini</a>,
                and with the support of the Ye'kuana people of Venezuela and the <a href="https://www.acoana.org/#home">
                La Asociación Venezolana para la Conservación de Áreas Naturales (ACOANA)</a> in Caracas, who facilitated the research,
                especially in getting the nod from Kuyujani, the tribal organization, in making my solo stay possible in the
                Ye'kuana village of Boca de Nichare, and arranging for the analysis of my samples at the 
                <a href="http://www.ucv.ve/">Universidad Central de Venezuela</a> in Caracas. My gratitude 
                towards the amazingly kind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye%27kuana">Ye'kuana people</a> who hosted
                and protected me in their forests, is boundless. The results of my study were not published, due to lack of adequate replications,
                but were shared with ACOANA to aid their work in the Caura forests. </p>

            <p> My work for the Wildlife Trust of India was mostly based from their headquarters in Delhi NCR. I worked initially to develop
              project plans with field teams working on conservation projects. Later, I moved to funding aspect of the work, where my role was mostly grant proposal
              writing, report writing, fundraising, dealing with donor-querries, mand building databases. In both roles, I worked on a wide variety
              of wildlife conservation projects, mostly focussed on large mammals (tiger, elephant, rhino, gibbons, etc.), birds (Sarus crane),
              ungulates (markhor and wild water buffalo), reptiles (gharial), marine fishes (whale shark). It also included ecosystem and landscape
              conservation projects (mangroves in Kerala, Manas in Assam, elephant corridors throughout the subcontinent) and assisting the forest departments
              in wildlife management (through running rescue centers, providing insurance to forest personnel, giving training and equipment to guards,
              assisting in human-wildlife conflicts, poaching, wildlife crime, and wildlife-related legal cases, reducing railroad accidents involving
              large mammals, etc.). I gained a broad and nuanced knowledge of India's forests and conservation situation by working on fine details
              of these projects, involving building detaitravelling to observe and analyze, and by interacting directly with field staff. </p>

            <p> I completed my Bachelor's (Science) in Agriculture from <a href="https://coavellayani.kau.in/">the College of Agriculture, Vellayani</a>, Thiruvananthapuram,
              one of the campuses of <a href="https://kau.in/">the Kerala Agricultural University (KAU)</a>. 
              The KAU syllabus had a range of mandatory courses (no electives), ranging from biology
              courses such as Botany, Plant taxonomy, Entomology, Biochemistry, Analytical Chemistry, and
              Microbiology to applied courses including Agronomy, Horticulture, Soil Science,
              Animal Husbandry, and Biotechnology, along with many supportive courses such as Economics, Agricultural Extension,
              Farm engineering, and Social sciences. The program included six months of extensive rural work.
              The impact of this program lasts throughout my career. I often took my KAU training for granted,
              and were pleasantly surprised, multiple times in my life, when it constantly and consistently
              helped me to see the forest for the trees, giving me an edge over people from other disciplines,

            <div class="h5">Personal Travel, Research and Writing</div>
            <p> By the end of my formal (BSc.) studies in Agriculture, I had become disappointed with chemical-based farming, and the collapse of the
              farming ecosystems in the state of Kerala. Though I wanted to go for a Masters study, some health issues sort of put a temporary hold on my hopes.
              For almost a year, as and when health allowed, I travelled throughout Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and met with people practicing alternative
              farming practices such as those influenced by Masanobu Fukuoka and Bill Mollison; farmers trying to save traditional
              crop varieties, cattle breeds, and farming systems; and activists working on a range of farm-related and environmental subjects. I also met with people working on
              other agriculture-related sustainable practices such as pottery and bamboo-based products, and on alternative education. With the help
              of a local birding group, I also learned the basics of bird-watching, mostly in farm ecosystems and protected forests.
              A main goal of my travels was to learn about alternative farming methods, and understand how Kerala's rice-farming systems
              collapsed since the 1970's. In the process, I familiarized myself with agricultural and natural landscapes
              of Kerala and Southern Tamil Nadu, and compiled information on plant-based DIY pesticides, fungicides
              and bactericides that could be used in agriculture and animal husbandry, and experimented with new combinations of such
              concoctions with the help of farmers. During the same period, I also started my career as a freelance journalist,
              and managed to get a couple of my articles on agriculture published. All my travel was supported by my parents during the period.</p>

            <p>I ended my independent research on farm issues by joining a local non-governmental activist and research group called <a href="https://thanal.co.in/">Thanal</a>.
              I worked with Thanal for about two years as a research associate. Most of my work was related to two things: (1) Kickstarting the group's
              <a href="https://thanal.co.in/save-our-rice-campaign/">"Save Our Rice"</a> project, a campaign aimed to conserve and sustain traditional
              rice farming, varities, seeds, and farm ecosystems. Along with another researcher, I did most of the initial legwork to set the ball moving,
              and now I learn that it has grown into a large collaborative project; (2) Kickstarting the group's second major project,
              <a href="https://thanaltrust.org/organic-bazaar/">Organic Bazaar</a>, a local organic-marketing initiative,
              perhaps the first of its kind in Kerala. I formulated the original standards for the 'organic' produce for the market,
              and helped in evaluation, while another person handled the marketing aspect. To read more about the initial phase, please download this.
              At Thanal, I also worked as a resource person and activist for Thanal's then flag-ship
              <a href="https://thanaltrust.org/programs/zerowaste-and-climate-action/">"Zero Waste"</a> project. I was also part of two research projects
              one on pesticide poisoning, and the other an investigation on POABS, a private company that used to ran the Thiruvananthapuram City's
              waste treatment plant, which had cause massive pollution in a the village it was located.
              Another major work was the regular monitoring of birds in the Vellayani fresh-water lake ecosystem in Thiruvananthapuram. </p>

            <p class="category">Yale and New York</p>
            <p> I did not return to being a full-time journalist, since Delhi, but continued to work for media groups.
              While doing my masters at Yale, I worked as a Research Assistant and Editorial Intern <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/">"Yale Environment 360"</a>,
              as it was starting to establish under the able editorial leadership of Roger Cohn, the former editor of Mother Jones and Audubon magazines.
              My work was mostly fact-checking news stories written by various professional journalists and authors.
              I was lucky enough to fact-check pieces written by excellent writers such as David Quammen, Fred Pearce, Richard Conniff, etc.
              After leaving E360, I worked for just over a month at <a href="https://www.audubon.org/audubonmagazine">"Audubon Magazine"</a>, New York,
              as an Editorial Intern. I fact-checked stories, and managed to get one story published, before moving to Washington D.C.,
                which offered me a proper job, in wildlife conservation.</p>

            <p>I started my journalism work as a Sub-editor with <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/">"The Financial Express "</a> (FE), the business newspaper of the Indian Express group, in New Delhi.
              My work in FE was mostly related to editing news stories, making newspaper pages, giving headlines, and captions, etc. Occasionally,
              I followed my drive to be a reporter, and managed to get a few stories, all on agriculture, published. Only one story reached the front page. 
              After a year at the FE, I moved to HT Media's new venture, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/">"Mint"</a>, as a Copy Editor, with similar responsibilities.
              I was a part of the launch team of Mint, which I guess is still doing well. By that time, I had realized that business journalism
              with large media-houses in Delhi was not fun, and I soon returned to science.
              My journalism career was short, but the impact it left seems to last forever.</p>

                <p> Studies conducted in forests have resulted in much of the ecological theory we build upon today. However, our basic understanding of forest ecology comes almost exclusively from the study of trees, even though they represent only a small
                  fraction of the plant diversity present in forests. In recent decades there has been an increasing number of studies of forest herbs, broadening our understanding of plant community ecology in forest ecosystems. Here we highlight ten recent studies examining patterns
                  and drivers of, as well as threats to, herbaceous plant diversity in forests. We first examine local, regional, and global patterns of herbaceous diversity in forests and how such patterns differ for woody versus herbaceous species. We then focus on ecological mechanisms
                  that contribute to forest herb diversity, including the role of abiotic and biotic interactions. We end by discussing some major anthropogenic impacts on forest herb diversity, identifying where herbs are particularly susceptible or particularly resilient
                  to current and predicted changes in comparison to trees.</p>

            <p> I acknowledge the tremendous privilege and advantage I enjoy from these external factors: </p> 
<p>(1) My Savarna Hindu caste privilege: I was born to a locally ‘forward’ Shudra caste, which has a high local social status and a deceptively large sociopolitical and ‘cultural’ clout, garnered over years of tactical subservience, loyalty, and strategic association with the higher-castes, the British, and the free-India’s political Left and Right. I condemn the historical and continuing atrocities done by the Savarnas to Dalits and Adivasis. </p>
<p>(2) The famed Kerala Model of Development: Aided by the land reforms brought in by the communists by 1970’s, decades of social struggles led by the likes of Ayyankali, Narayana Guru, and T.K. Madhavan, wide-spread literacy movement, deep political awareness, progressive artists, and affirmative action from the governments, the Kerala model gave me great personal advantage. The state's unique socio-political and cultural advancement played a huge role in my personal quests. </p>
<p>(3) The socialist, secular Constitution of India, the socialist governments, judiciary, and media that managed to keep the essence of democracy alive for a long time. India, shaped by Gandhi-Nehru-Ambedkar-Communist ethos, gave me ridiculously cheap (almost free) education and medical care, and legally guaranteed me the right to life, dignity, and freedom of speech, while growing up, and for that I am eternally grateful. </p> 
<p>(4) The sacrifices of my parents, who invested all their money, time, and health in caring for and educating their children. They fought the unforgiving conservative value systems of the Kerala middle-class to guarantee me the freedom I needed.</p>
